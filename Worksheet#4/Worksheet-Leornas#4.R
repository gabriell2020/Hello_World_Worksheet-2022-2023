 df
 #b. Find the mean of shoe size and height of the respondents.
 #Copy the codes and results.
summary(df)

# SHOESIZE: Mean   : 9.411
# HEIGHT:   Mean   :68.57 

#c. Is there a relationship between shoe size and height? Why?

# Yes, The Higher the height, the greater the shoesize.
#the factor levels below the actual values.

Months <- c("March","April","January","November","January",
"September","October","September","November","August",
"January","November","November","February","May","August",
"July","December","August","August","September","November","February","April")

#3. Then check the summary() of the months_vector and factor_months_vector. |
  #Interpret the results of both vectors. Are they both equally useful in this case?
summary(Months)

#4. Create a vector and factor for the table below.
factorData <- data.frame(
  Direction = c("East","West","North"),
  Frequency = c(1,4,3)
)

#5. Enter the data below in Excel with file name = import_march.csv

#a. Import the excel file into the Environment Pane using read.table() function.
library(readxl)
import_march <- read_excel("Worksheet#4/import_march.xlsx")
View(import_march)
import_march
#b. View the dataset. Write the code and its result.
